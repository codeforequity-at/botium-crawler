The **Botium Crawler** is doing the work of detecting the conversation flows supported by your chatbot by itself. It does so by analyzing the **quick responses** offered by your chatbot and **simulating clicks on all of the options** in parallel, following all pathes down **until it reaches the end of the conversation**.

All detected conversation flows along all pathes are saved as Botium test cases and utterance lists and can be used as base for a **regression test set**.
